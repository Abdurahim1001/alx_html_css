2. Hero Section
A visually appealing Hero Section that features a background image, a headline, a sub-headline, and a Call to Action button.
3. What We Do Section
This section highlights what the business or organization does with the help of icons and brief descriptions of services.
4. Our Results Section
A results-driven section that uses custom pentagon icons to display statistics and success metrics. Text overlays the icons to present clear, engaging information.
5. Contact Us Form
A simple, user-friendly form where users can input their Name, Email, and Message. The form is centered on the page with bold labels above each input field, and fields are styled with underlines rather than boxes for a sleek design.
